## Abstract

For successful regeneration, the identity of the missing tissue must
be specified according to the pre-existing tissue. Planarians are
ideal for the study of the mechanisms underlying this process because
the same field of cells can regrow a head or a tail according to the
missing body part. After amputation, the differential activation of
the WNT/beta-catenin signal specifies anterior versus posterior
identity. Initially, both ''wnt1'' and ''notum'' (Wnt inhibitor) are
expressed in all wounds, but 48 hours later they are restricted to
posterior or anterior facing wounds, respectively, by an unknown
mechanism. Here we show that 12 hours after amputation the chromatin
accessibility of cells in the wound region changes according to the
polarity of the pre-existing tissue in a WNT/beta-catenin-dependent
manner. Genomic analyses suggest that homeobox transcription factors
and chromatin-remodeling proteins are direct WNT/betacatenin targets,
which trigger the expression of posterior effectors. Finally, we
identified FoxG as a ''wnt1'' up-stream regulator, probably via binding
to its first intron enhancer.
